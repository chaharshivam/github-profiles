# GitHub Profiles

This application uses the GitHub API to search for users. It displays the user information and their top 4 repositories based on forks and stars. I use the concept of promises, XMLHttpRequest in javascript to get the user data.

### Technologies used
- HTML
- Sass
- Vanilla Javascript

I have also Added dark/light mode
